## Beschrijving
A potion mixing game for merlin studios.
there are three levels where you learn about some ingredients, search where the ingridients can be, and you make the potions.

## Gebruik
As a curious alchemist, I want a comprehensive website where I can explore and experiment with various ingredients to brew unique potions. I want to learn about different ingredients, their properties, and how to combine them to create potions with different effects. The website should emphasize creativity, accessibility, and feature captivating animations, designs, and effects to showcase the digital magic. Additionally, I would like an overview page of all potions with filtering options based on different criteria.
